# Homework-1-Code-Refractor

Horiseon is a marketing agency to help businesses optimize their SEO. This assignment was done to refractor a given code, using HTML index and CSS styling.This code was refractored by cleaning up the HTML language to follow semantic HTML. I changed the divs to navs, included article id's with the appropriate class assigned to it. Footer was also included at the bottom. I also consolidated CSS to make sure it followed along with the HTML semantics, cleaning up the repetive aspects. Code was then organized to follow the Scout's Rule, for the purposes of making it easier for the user to read. To build this code, technology used was a macbook air and it was built on visual studio code. It also utilized an HTML to create elements, a CSS to style the html elements, git to track changes to source code, and git hub where my repository exists to be deployed to github pages!
